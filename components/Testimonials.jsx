    text: `Always my go to place on weekends!!
Best agro resort near hadshi Lake..staff is polite...and unlike other restaurants the owner himself takes care of everything!
Must go if you are an authentic food lover.
The food tastes like home!! The rooms are cozy and the view from the rooms is just‚ú®‚ú® the environment is silent and warm...best on rainy days.
All the rooms are lakeside and the resort is too easy to find as it is road touch.
I visited Satya Sai Baba Mandir which was about 2-3 km away from it.
The costing was reasonable as wellüòÑüòÑ
Will definitely visit again!! `,
